# Hijack.rcc Creation
Run `Create Resources.bat` to automatically launch `rcc.exe` with the correct parameters to create `hijack.rcc` based on the contents in the `hijackrcc` folder.  
QT uses the `.qrc` file inside the `hijackrcc` folder to formulate the file list inside `hijack.rcc`.  
You can use `Create qrc File.py`, which requires Python, to create a `.qrc` file if you have modified the `hijackrcc` folder.
