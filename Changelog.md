# Changelog
## Version 1.0.2
Added easy to modify window sizes, in `Constants.qml`.  
Added bool for selecting all characters in Database note boxes, in `Constants.qml`. Default is false.  
Added back parallaxes, which are always enabled by default now, but are displayed below images in the `scaled` folder (This allows viewing of maps almost exactly as they will appear in-game, also allows viewing maps that only have parallaxes).  
Changed the "Show in editor" tickbox under parallax selection in map properties to instead enable/disable `scaled` folder images. This can help with crash prevention if a maps image file is extremely large.  
Added a custom `Splash.png`, Thank you pigmask for the base.
